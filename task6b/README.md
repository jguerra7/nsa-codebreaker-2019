# Task 6b - Future Message Decryption

## Prompt

Though we might be unable to decrypt messages sent and received in the past without a user's private key, it may still be possible to view future messages in the clear. For this task generate a new public/private key pair and make whatever changes are necessary such that all future messages sent/received within TerrorTime may be decrypted with this private key. Critically, you can not disrupt future legitimate conversations between users.
