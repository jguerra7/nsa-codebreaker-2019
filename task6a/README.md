# Task 6a - Message Spoofing

## Prompt

The ability to masquerade as a TerrorTime user is helpful, even when we are not able to access the plaintext version of their messages. We want to be able to send "spoofed" messages (i.e., messages appearing to be from the user we are masquerading as) to other TerrorTime users as a way of disrupting their attack plans. Critically, any conversation we have as the masqueraded user should never be visible to that user the next time they access their account. But complicating matters is the fact that all messages sent and received through TerrorTime are archived on the chat server and downloaded each time a user logs in to their account. For this task, identify a vulnerabilty that will allow you to send/receive messages as a TerrorTime user without that user ever seeing those messages the next time they access their account. To prove your solution, submit the encrypted message body of a spoofed message that was sent from the organization leader to a cell leader. Submit the full client id of the cell leader you chose. Put the organization leader's account in a state such that replies to your spoofed message will never be seen by them, but still readable by you.
